#### Prerequesites

 - EmberJs with 2.18 version (Installation with  : `npm install -g ember-cli@2.11`)
 - PHP >= 7.3
-----
In order to run the project just.... `run.sh` 

(Make sure to have the port 4200 available. By default Laravel will use port 8000 and if busy will check 8001, 8002 until he finds an available one)

##### Running the projects separately

1. For Backend (Laravel) : `php artisan serve`
2. For FrontEnd (EmberJs 2.18) : `ember serve`
